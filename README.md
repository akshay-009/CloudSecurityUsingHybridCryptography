# Cloud-Encryption
CS3031 - Project 2


The aim of this project is to develop a secure cloud storage application for Dropbox, Box, Google
Drive, Office365 etc. For example, your application will secure all files that are uploaded to the cloud,
such that only people that are part of your “Secure Cloud Storage Group” will be able to decrypt your
uploaded files. To all other users the files will be encrypted.
You are required to design and implement a suitable key management system for your application that
will allow you to share files securely, and add or remove users from your group. You are free to
implement your application for a desktop or mobile platform and make use of any open source
cryptographic libraries.

## How To
In order to run this program you need to first create a google drive API credential named as `client_secret.json` and save it in the `src` directory.
Then you must run `main.exe`


If you want the UI version, again same as above with the client secret. Go into `src/GUI` and run `main.exe`
